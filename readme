One day, I got really bored and was thinking about my grades. I decided to make this program which offers a GPA calculator with some useful
hints to help the user and allows you to implement different classes. I ended up liking it quite a lot; although simple, it is quite resourceful.
Python program that calculates your GPA. It takes in the amount of credit hours you have taken and the scores you have received in those classes. 

I have seen many people not know how to calculate their GPA and this is a perfect solution. 
This was designed with UT grading system in mind, should work with other colleges as well.
