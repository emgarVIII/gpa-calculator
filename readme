One day, I got really bored and was thinking about my grades. I decided to make this program which offers a GPA calculator with some useful
hints to help the user and allows you to implement different classes. I have had friends use it and they all like it!

I ended up liking it quite a lot; although simple, it is quite resourceful and insightful. I love the compact size and simplicity.

SUMMARY: Python program that calculates your GPA. It takes in the amount of credit hours you have taken and the scores you have received in those classes. 

I have seen many people not know how to calculate their GPA and this is a perfect solution. It gives user hints as to finding how much a class is worth.
This was designed with UT grading system in mind, should work with other colleges as well but cannot confirm with all as different Universities weigh differently.
